# Breaking-Bricks
First Project assigned from General Assembly


For this first project I will be creating the arcade classics, "BRICK BREAKERS".
This game will have 3 levels and 3 difficulty settings

DIFFICULTY:
The difficulty setting can be set to easy, medium, or hard. The only variable that changes within the difficulty setting is the velocity in which the ball moves. In the easy mode setting, the ball will move at the slowest velocity of the 3 difficulty settings and at hard mode, the ball move at the fastest velocity.

LEVELS:
As for the different levels, the paddle will get smaller and the life force of the bricks will increase. In level 1, the paddle will be 1.5 times the size of the bricks and the life force of the bricks will be very low. One hit with the ball will result in the destruction of the bricks. 
In Level 2, the paddle size will reduce to the size of the bricks and the bricks life force will increase. The bricks will now be able to take 2 hits before being destroyed. 
In level 3, the paddle size will reduce to half the size of the bricks and the bricks life force will further increase. The bricks will now be able to take 3 hits before being destroyed.

BRICKS:
In all levels there will be 6 rows of bricks spaced evenly. As for the total amount, there will be 27 total bricks. When a ball destroys any of the bricks, the brick doesn't just disappears, it shows the particles of the broken brick and then it is removed completely. This part will have an animation effect for it to occur. 

WIN/LOSE:
When the ball hits the bottom of the page, the game is over. A big sign will appear and show "YOU LOST" on the board. From this point, you can no longer continue on to play the game. Your only options are is to restart the game or exit. When you win or beat a level, a big sign will appear and show "COMPLETED". The game will show your score for that level. Then another sign will appear that shows "NEXT LEVEL." This will then lead to the next level. When you completed all the levels, a sign will show "CONGRATULATIONS" and your total score will be shown.

SCORE:
Your score will be presented on the top right corner of the game. It will be continuously added up as you hit and/or destroy each of the bricks. Wnen a player moves on to the next level, the score will be tracked and can continuously increase. There is also a time component to the game in which, the scores will raise up furthermore after the completion of each level. The faster the level is completed, the more extra points is awarded to the player.
