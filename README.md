# Breaking-Bricks
First Project assigned from General Assembly

For this first project I will be creating the arcade classics, "BRICK BREAKERS".
This game will have 3 levels and 3 difficulty settings

## DIFFICULTY:
The difficulty is already set by default. You have 5 lives and the ball moves at a pretty fast rate. So the game can be pretty tough for beginners.

## BRICKS:
There  are 6 columns of bricks spaced evenly and 4 rows of bricks also spaced evenly. There will be a total amount of 24 bricks. When a ball destroys any of the bricks, the brick will disappear from the game and the ball will reverse directions. 

## WIN/LOSE:
When the ball hits the bottom of the page, the ball will reset back to the center of the page with the paddle. The ball will immediately leave the paddle right after it hits the bottom of the page. A life will be taken away which is presented on the top right corner. Once the lives count drops to 0, A big sign will appear and show "FAILURE" on the board. From this point on, you can no longer continue on to play the game. Your only options is is to refresh the page. When you win, a big sign will appear and show "CONGRATULATIONS". The game will show your score for that level. 

## SCORE:
Your score will be presented on the top left corner of the game. It will continuously add up as you hit and/or destroy each of the bricks. Each brick is worth 100 points and since there are a total number of 24 bricks, the total number of points to win is 2400.
